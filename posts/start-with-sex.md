I laugh that I'm changing the world one fuck at a time. New lovers often tell me that our time together has made them think: they've started to look back on previous experiences and wonder if perhaps they could have acted better; they notice how fully I was participating in and enjoying what we are doing; we've expanded their definition of sex and had all kinds of conversations about getting it on; my boundaries are clear and theirs are respected. It sounds like I'm bragging - and I do like to brag - but what I really hear is how desperately screwed up our sexual culture really is.



Don't they always feel so confident their partners were into having sex with them?

What have they done with other people's boundaries?

Are they really settling for such lacklustre experiences?



When these conversations started I was in the middle of belatedly giving myself a thorough sex education, reading everything I could find online.  I had experiences that I was trying to make sense of and wanted to avoid repeating. The more I learnt, the more I realised there was to learn, and whilst my traditional education may have taught me to solve quadratic equations (a skill I have not used once in my adult life) it certainly didn't prepare me for navigating all the messier bits of life - sex and love and mental health.

**Good sex ed changes lives**

Sex ed often starts and finishes with harm reduction - how to avoid STIs and unwanted pregnancies. A huge piece is missing from this equation: _pleasure_. The fact that we pursue sexual and romantic relationships because they are rewarding, fulfilling, they feel good.



There's a myth that sex ed is about biology, mechanics and medical details. Really, when I'm working as a youth sex educator I spend most of my time talking about feelings and about relationships.  Relationships with ourselves, between lovers, between friends, within families. For most of us, for most of our life, having strong relationships is going to be a crucial factor in our overall wellbeing so we'd best make them good ones.



We could take our harm reduction lens to relationships. I think we've all had or know someone who has had relationships that have hurt. Not necessarily because they were abusive but because the people in that relationship didn't have the tools they needed to be kind to themselves and each other. Someone I love describes it as like learning to drive a car; we don't hand someone the keys and let them loose on the road with this machine capable of doing a whole lot of damage to other people, but we happily raise adults who have no idea how to navigate feelings to form healthy relationships and end up crashing into those they care about.



That's still a pretty pessimistic outlook. Sure, the _first do no harm_ principle applies, but what about _leave things better than you found them_? I don't mean let's go out and try to "fix" anyone - we can, after all, only change ourselves - but what about building relationships that actively enrich everyone's lives?



When we as individuals learn to pursue healthy, joyful sexual and romantic relationships, we learn to pursue fulfilment. That we get to have desires, to seek pleasure. Since it's harder to build good relationships with others without first having a good relationship with ourselves, we learn self-worth, confidence, boundaries. We build emotional intelligence. There's a ripple effect out into the rest of our lives.



We also learn to be good to one another - to feel good and help each other feel good.



That's no trivial thing. Feelings _are _the fabric of our lives; any meaning we pursue must necessarily come from our own experiences. Not just the things we do and say and think but _how it feels_ to do and say and think them.  In the absence of faith in any higher power the only reasonable thing I can see to do with my few moments on this earth is to enjoy it as much as I possibly can. Sure it's an achievement to run six marathons this year or be the youngest ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but are you happy?



Good sex ed gives us the gift of being able to put down all the stories that suggest what _ought_ to make us feel good, and  ask ourselves instead _what do I really want?_

Sex ed is not just about making my life or your life more pleasurable.



Our closest relationships are a microcosm of our societal relationships. Yet so often we are reactive, selfish or hurtful to the people around us - whether out of entitlement or because we simply don't have the tools to do better. If I can't meet my friends and lovers with care and respect, how will I ever extend it to strangers?



Building strong relationships means recognising ourselves and others as_ emotionally complex powerhouses_, to steal a phrase from adrienne maree brown. We have to acknowledge everyone's agency, to respect difference and practice empathy. In _[Pleasure Activism](https://theglowup.theroot.com/book-excerpt-love-as-political-resistance-from-adrienn-1833544520)_ Brown goes on to say _We donâ€™t learn to love in a linear path, from self to family to friends to spouse, as we might have been taught. We learn to love by loving. We practice with each other, on ourselves, in all kinds of relationships._ In learning to take other people's perspectives and to love generously, we are building the foundations of something much bigger.



Our personal relationships are a breeding ground for compassion and acceptance. While alone that may not seem like much, we are setting out our values - _treat others as they want to be treated, listen to what others say they need_ - and acting on them. We are defining the behaviours we consider acceptable and challenging ourselves to live up to them.



Small changes add up. At some point, we start to look beyond how you and I interact, and begin to think about how a society that was truly built for everyone would look. Any culture is made up of the small acts of many individuals over time, and our impact in the world doesn't lie solely in the masterpieces or movements we create, but also in how we affect the people around us every day - sometimes in profound ways.



When it articulates and celebrates difference, sex ed is not only an end in and of itself but also the foundation on which to build a culture where if you're someone who is queer or poor or fat or Black or disabled or some or none of those things you have just as much right to care and respect as everyone else. One that embraces the fact that we get to ask for what we want, we get to offer what we can give - and maybe the things I need aren't the same as the things you need, or maybe there are things you can give that I can't and that's totally normal.

**Fucking is a political act**

The personal is political and fucking is a political act. Politics is not just about who wins what election, it's about how power plays out in all kinds of communities and relationships. Who is entitled to pleasure and comfort? Who has bodily autonomy, sexual agency? Who has[ access](https://www.sistersong.net/reproductive-justice) to healthcare and other resources?



If our education insists that sex is penis-in-vagina intercourse between a cis-gender man and a cis-gender woman then huge swathes of the population are by default excluded. Inclusive sex ed eliminates those assumptions and talks about the vast range of sexual experience, which goes a long way to tearing apart those myths. No kind of sex is morally better or worse than any other kind of sex, and that alone is actually pretty radical for many.



When we take that into our own lives, whatever our gender or sexual orientation, we can question the roles that we are playing and the acts that are open to us. We start to run into our limiting beliefs - and prejudices. Why do we assume that in a straight-cis couple the man must be the insertive partner during intercourse? Why do so many straight folks claim that they're all for trans inclusion whilst simultaneously refusing to date anyone who's trans? Who we fuck and how we fuck them is political because it reveals just what - and who - we deem acceptable and desirable.



Talking about fucking is political too - how we talk about sex reflects exactly how we think of other people. Are they[ living a life as vivid and complex as our own](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder)? Or are they simply fulfilling a function in our life, or else a freak or a nuisance? To put the lessons of sex education into practice, we need to have nuanced discussions about the ways sexuality and gender and ablesim - to name but a few - impact on the lived experiences of our potential partners every day.



In our sexual education we begin with _my body, my rules_, and we establish our own power. _My body, my rules_ says I know how I get to be treated and I will demand my due. To really embed that lesson though, we must extend it to _your body, your rules_, and act like we believe it. _Your body, your rules_ says I know how you have a right to be treated - and I will fight your fight with you.



_Your body, your rules_ means it's your business who you have sex with. Who you fall in love with. Who you should be able to marry.



_Your body, your rules_ means that you are the expert on your gender, how you present and the pronouns you use.



_Your body, your rules_ means your reproductive choices are yours to make.



_Your body, your rules_ means you should have access to the knowledge and resources you need to live out those choices.



_Your body, your rules_ is about _your rights_.
